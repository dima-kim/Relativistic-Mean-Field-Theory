# Relativistic-Mean-Field-Theory
This code solves the self-consistent relativistic Dirac, Meson, and Coulomb equations in the context of Nuclear Physics. 

This theory was first developed and solved by C. J. Horowitz and B. D. Serot in Nucl. Phys. A368 (1981) 503-528. 

This code is written in python, hoping to be accessible to young scientists in the field. Of course, this means that solving heavy nuclei will be very slow. Once one understands the python code, conversion to C++ or Fortran should be straightforward.
