# Relativistic-Mean-Field-Theory
This code solves the self-consistent relativistic Dirac, Meson, and Coulomb equations in the context of Nuclear Physics. This theory was first developed and solved by C. J. Horowitz and B. D. Serot in Nucl. Phys. A368 (1981) 503-528. This code is written in python because I hope it to be easy to understand for young scientists entering the field.
